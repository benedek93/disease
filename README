0. Overview
===========

This is a very simple test of a probabilistic cellular automaton, simulating
the spread of a disease or virus across a grid of organisms.

Each cell can be susceptible, from where it can (with some probability) transition
to an infected state if it has infected neighbors.  From that state, it will get
removed with some chance.  If it is removed and has susceptible neighbors, it can
become susceptible again.


1. Compilation
==============

The program depends on the SDL library ( http://www.libsdl.org/ ), so you will need
to have the development version of it installed.

If everything is set up properly, a simple
 $ make
should suffice.


2. Usage
========

After the program has compiled successfully, type
 $ ./disease -h
for a list of options.

When the program is running, you can click on the field to start an infection.


Have fun!
